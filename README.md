Learning Python with CodeWithHarry

## Python Practice Projects üêç

This repository contains Python practice projects I'm working on while learning from [CodeWithHarry](https://www.codewithharry.com/). These help me understand core Python concepts.

## Topics Covered

- Variables and Data Types
- Conditionals and Loops
- Functions
- And more...

## How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```

## Note on Python's Typing

Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning you don't need to declare variable types explicitly. The type of a variable is determined at runtime, unlike statically typed languages where types are checked at compile time

## Variable Naming Rules in Python

- Variable names can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_).
- They must begin with a letter or underscore, not a digit.
- Variable names are case-sensitive (`myVar` and `myvar` are different).
- Reserved keywords (like `for`, `if`, `class`, etc.) cannot be used as variable names.
- Avoid using special characters (such as `@`, `$`, `%`, etc.) in variable names.
- Use descriptive names to make code more readable.

**Examples:**

```python
valid_name = 10
_validName = 20
valid_name_2 = 30
# Invalid examples:
# 2invalid = 40
# my-var = 50
# for = 60
```

## Basic Rules of Python

- Indentation is crucial; it defines code blocks (typically 4 spaces).
- Statements end with a newline, not a semicolon.
- Variable names are case-sensitive and should be descriptive.
- Comments start with `#` for single-line or triple quotes for multi-line.
- Strings can be enclosed in single (`'`), double (`"`), or triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`).
- Python uses dynamic typing; variable types can change at runtime.
- Use `import` to include modules and libraries.
- Functions are defined using the `def` keyword.
- Code should follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines for readability

## Built-in Data Types in Python

Python supports several built-in data types, including:

- **Numbers:** `int`, `float`, `complex`
- **Strings:** `str`
- **Boolean:** `bool`
- **Sequences:** `list`, `tuple`, `range`
- **Lists:** Ordered, mutable collections (`list`)
  - Elements maintain insertion order.
  - Items can be changed, added, or removed.
  - Defined with square brackets: `[1, 2, 3]`.
- **Tuples:** Ordered, immutable collections (`tuple`)
  - Elements maintain insertion order.
  - Items cannot be changed after creation.
  - Defined with parentheses: `(1, 2, 3)`.
- **Mapping:** `dict`
  - Stores key-value pairs.
  - Keys must be unique and immutable.
  - Values can be of any type and are mutable.
  - Defined with curly braces: `{"key": "value"}`.
- **Set Types:** `set`, `frozenset`
- **None Type:** `NoneType`

**Examples:**

```python
num = 42                # int
pi = 3.14               # float
name = "Harry"          # str
is_active = True        # bool
numbers = [1, 2, 3]     # list
coordinates = (4, 5)    # tuple
user = {"id": 1}        # dict
unique = {1, 2, 3}      # set
nothing = None          # NoneType
```

## Typecasting in Python

Typecasting is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another. Python provides built-in functions for typecasting:

- `int()`: Converts to integer
- `float()`: Converts to floating-point number
- `str()`: Converts to string
- `bool()`: Converts to boolean
- `list()`, `tuple()`, `set()`, `dict()`: Convert to respective collection types

**Examples:**

```python
a = "123"
b = int(a)      # b is now 123 (int)
c = float(a)    # c is now 123.0 (float)
d = str(456)    # d is now "456" (str)
e = bool(0)     # e is False
f = list("abc") # f is ['a', 'b', 'c']
```

Typecasting is useful when you need to perform operations that require specific data types.
